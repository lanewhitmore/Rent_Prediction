# India Housing Rent Prediction
 This project is a part of the ADS-505 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego. 

-- Project Status: [Completed]

## Installation

To use this project on your own machine, follow these instructions:

git init

git clone https://github.com/lanewhitmore/Rent_Prediction.git

## Project Objectives

The main purpose of this project is to leverage the Indian rent listing data provided by MagicBricks into a predictive regression model that can become a deployed application for users to compare listings of interest to. The primary goal would be to offer consumers a set of information that will separate MagicBricks from other listing websites and drive more interactions and therefore advertisment revenue on their websites.

## Project Description

The dataset has been acquired from MagicBricks. It contains 4,747 records that includes 11 variables; time of listing y/m/d, bedroom + hall + kitchen, rent, size, floor, area type, area locality, city, furnishing status, tenant preferred, bathroom, and point of contact. For the purposes of the business objective, rent will be our dependent variable and regression techniques will be used to predict it. The primary concerns or questions will be: how accurate of a model can we create? Which regression technique will that be? What percentage of error will such a model have? What dollar and rupee amount will that error be? The primary roadblock to finding a successful regression model will be the dataset size limitatiions. After splitting the training and test set the models may be limited by training size.
